        <h3>NEWS</h3>
          <h4>RELEASE 0.3.0</h4>
            <p class="fs-important">POSTED: OCT 06th, 2021</p>  
            <p>
            It's been a while lol. Not exactly what I was hoping for, I have been working on a few other mods in the time since the last post. I made a lot of progress however the remote workspace bumbed up in
            MCreator and I lost all the work I did sadly. The good news is the GitHub files still worked but it was from 0.2.1 so I have to add back things slowly now.
            The update would have easily taken me more months to compley and the wiki maybe even double that so it may have been for the better.
            </p>
            <p>
            I still have the resources saved on my external hard-drive so I can add the features planned in a future update maybe a little bit at a time but it will not be in a huge major update like I was planning.
            The good news is I did some minor work on improving the Auto Farming Machine fixing the tags for it and some other elements making them a lot better, and even found some time to add a new feature
            for upgrades, some GUI improvements and such, the other blocks will have a overhaul soon too. But this should be a good start to get me back into making the mod.
            </p>

          <h4>PROGRESS VIDEO INBOUND</h4>
            <p class="fs-important">POSTED: AUG 28th, 2021</p>  
            <p>
            Hello and welcome! The wiki pages are coming along really nicely, they are taking a bit of time to make but I have done many improvements including adding a social image for the site.
            I made it though all the wiki pages for tools but have still many other areas to cover.
            Partly why its taking long for a release is I want to make sure there is a decent amount of documentation added for the mod.
            Once there is a structure in place and all the wiki pages are cought up then it will go alot faster for development.
            </p>
            <p>
            As far as the mod's current state its currently around 50% done, however tags are going to be change a bit in this update making them less long and easier for adding to third party mods.
            This basically will delay things a slite however as typing texts gets boaring after a while looking at the same lines on a new page (HTML/CSS) its a nice break when I do work on the new tags.
            With that being said I will make a update video on the mod progress as I think the mod site will be a huge part of the project not just for keep track of changes, and providing infromation, but
            promotional and version arcives as well.
            </p>

          <h4>MAJOR WEBSITE CHANGES</h4>
            <p class="fs-important">POSTED: AUG 22th, 2021</p>  
            <p>
            Since the last news post I have been working hard on getting the website to look a bit better, major changes have been made to the CSS script for the site. 
            The site now should be more mobile friendly and easier to read. This was no small task to implment, I still have the wiki to work on as I did start a few pages for it.
            However, now that most of the site is set up, and now that there is a dedicated downloads page it will be fine to coninue with the development.
            </p>
            <p>
            There are still things I would like to work on but the most important part was having the downloads, and main mod pages set up and viewable for everyone.
            This upcoming week I will be working mainly on the modification and wiki pages, I will try to spread out the time on both projects.
            But for now I am taking the rest of the weekend off to relax and wind down.
            </p>
        <div class="h-line-dash"></div>
          <h4>RECIPES NOW 79% DONE</h4>
            <p class="fs-important">POSTED: AUG 20th, 2021</p>  
            <p>
            Just a quick update, at the moment recipes are 79% complete. Armor has a known issues using the new tag system and has been disabled for now. I tested 2021.2 to see if the issue was in that MCreator version and its not, 
            So tag support should be coming after MCreator 2021.2 is released. There are just a few recipes still needing to be worked on but I need to finish adding the devices, and adding support for the new padlock.
            </p>
            <p>
            The next two or so days will be focused on finishing the reworking of the right-click procedures for the devices, the script is made, all I need to do is addapt it to the the exisiting blocks and test them again. 
            This should take over the weekend to do but will be worth it in the end as from testing its much more enjoyable with the new sounds.
            </p>
        <div class="h-line-dash"></div>
          <h4>ITEMS COMPLETE 0.3.0</h4>
            <p class="fs-important">POSTED: AUG 18th, 2021</p>  
            <p>
            Currently progress is going well, many things have moved to the testing phase, and all the items are now added and done. Blocks are not to far to follow. After which I will be focusing on getting the reworking done for the block already added in the last two update.
            May recipes are still needing testing, I think I may have tested them but I don't remember doing it so I will be testing them again just to be safe. Also one thing still neededing to do for crafting/smelting recipes is make them unlocable, this will need to be done before testing.
            </p>
            <p>
            I have also added many more auto crafting recipes to the list of things to add, some recipes are not possible to fully automate so I have not bothered to add them until they can be automated, it saves work this way. Regarding the other devices,
            they will be added in good time, I still have to finish the padlock, its mostly done, I have some minor stuff to do like sound effects and such but, other than that its been tested with the auto fishing machine and seems to work properly.
            </p>
            <p>
            On that note, it may be a couple more weeks until the release, I am not going to know when until I am on the final stages of testing which by then it will be quickly published after testing is done. Any bugfixes will be release aftwords.
            </p>
        <div class="h-line-dash"></div>
          <h4>NWTG AUTOMATION SITE WIKI</h4>
            <p class="fs-important">POSTED: AUG 16th, 2021</p>  
            <p>
            Some grate new! this site will be getting a dedicated wiki section for the mod, this will take a bit of time to prep for and maintain but it should be fairly easy to make basic like data lists for tags, 
            and some more advanced things may take a bit more time to figure out like crafting recipes.
            </p>
            <p>
            there is no set date for the wiki to be added however I am working on putting togeter a auto crafting machine recipe page, which will show basic recipes for the auto crafting machine. Its coded in HTML, CSS and a bit of java script.
            The styling takes the most time to work on and making sure the new elements are stable for mobile and tablet users for at least landscape view takes time as often things need to be fixed when new things are added.
            </p>
        <div class="h-line-dash"></div>
          <h4>NWTG AUTOMATION 0.3.0 PROGRESS</h4>
            <p class="fs-important">POSTED: AUG 11th, 2021</p>  
            <p>
            Development is coming along really well, The Auto Fishing Machine is just about done. There is some work still needed to be done on the Padlock block, however, 
            I am happy with the progress I have made over the last few days with the mod.
            </p>
            <p>
            One of the things I am thinking about doing is tutorials for each machine on how to use them, how to craft them etc. This will save time for updating the wiki pages for 
            the modification and will give people a better idea how things work with an in-game example.
            </p>
