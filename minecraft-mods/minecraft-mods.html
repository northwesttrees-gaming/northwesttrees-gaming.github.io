      <h4>MOD DEVELOPMENT</h4>
      <p>We create all of our Minecraft mods with a free Minecraft code generator called MCreator. 
         As much as many forge members say its a bad program after working with it for over three years, 
         I can say it has some limitations, however, it is possible to make very advanced things.</p>
      <p>Some Projects I have worked on in the past with MCreator have been Energy mods using variables to pass power to other blocks, 
         Automatic tasks, code generator, and even cctv cameras. I won't like it takes a lot of testing and years to master, however,
         I don't think there is much that can't be done, if not right now, then when support is added in future updates.</p>
